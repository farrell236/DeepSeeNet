-----------------------

DeepSeeNet is a high-performance deep learning framework for grading of color fundus photographs using the AREDS simplified severity scale. For more details, please see `<https://ncbi-nlp.github.io/DeepSeeNet/>`_.

Getting Started with DeepSeeNet
===============================

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and run on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
The package should successfully install on Linux.

Installing
----------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*  python =3.6
*  tensorflow >=1.6.0
*  keras =2.2.4
*  Linux

Tensorflow can be downloaded from `https://www.tensorflow.org <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_.


Installing from source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Download the source code from GitHub: ``git clone https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/DeepSeeNet.git``
2. Change to the directory of ``DeepSeeNet``
3. Install required packages: ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
4. Add the code directory to ``PYTHONPATH``: ``export PYTHONPATH=.:$PYTHONPATH``


Using DeepSeeNet for grading simplified scores
----------------------------------------------

The easiest way is to run the following command

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python examples/predict_simplified_score.py data/left_eye.jpg data/right_eye.jpg
   ...
   Downloading data from https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/DeepSeeNet/releases/download/0.1/drusen_model.h5
   INFO:root:Loading the model: /tmp/.keras/datasets/drusen_model.h5
   Downloading data from https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/DeepSeeNet/releases/download/0.1/pigment_model.h5
   INFO:root:Loading the model: /tmp/.keras/datasets/pigment_model.h5
   Downloading data from https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/DeepSeeNet/releases/download/0.1/advanced_amd_model.h5
   INFO:root:Loading the model: /tmp/.keras/datasets/advanced_amd_model.h5
   ...
   INFO:root:Processing: data/left_eye.jpg
   INFO:root:Processing: data/right_eye.jpg
   ...
   INFO:root:Risk factors: {'pigment': (0, 0), 'advanced_amd': (0, 0), 'drusen': (2, 2)}
   The simplified score: 2

The script will

1. Download the models from the ``DeepSeeNet`` repository
2. Predict the simplified score based on the sample left and right eyes

More options (e.g., setting the models) can be obtained by running

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python examples/predict_simplified_score.py --help


Pre-trained DeepSeeNet models
-----------------------------

Besides grading the simplified score, we also provide individual risk factor models. For example

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python examples/predict_drusen.py data/left_eye.jpg
   ...
   INFO:root:Loading the model: /tmp/.keras/datasets/drusen_model.h5
   ...
   INFO:root:Processing: data/left_eye.jpg
   ...
   The drusen score: [[0.21020733 0.2953384  0.49445423]]
   The drusen size: large

Here, we provide the following pre-trained models:

*  `drusen size <https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/DeepSeeNet/releases/tag/0.1>`_: non/small, intermediate, large
*  `pigmentary abnormalities <https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/DeepSeeNet/releases/tag/0.1>`_: no, yes
*  `late AMD <https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/DeepSeeNet/releases/tag/0.1>`_: no, yes
*  `geographic atrophy (GA) <https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/DeepSeeNet/releases/tag/0.2>`_: no, yes
*  `central GA <https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/DeepSeeNet/releases/tag/0.2>`_: no, yes


Training DeepSeeNet model
-------------------------

You can train the individual risk factor model too. For example

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python examples/train.py data/pigment_label_sample.csv data/pigment_best_model.h5
   ...
   Epoch 1/100
   2/2 [==============================] - 27s 14s/step - loss: 1.0103 - acc: 0.5148...
   ...
   early stopping


The program will read images and labels from a CSV file, train the model, and save the latest best model according to the ``val_acc``.
